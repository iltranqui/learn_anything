<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A personal repository for contents about what I am learning in tech and in the world of machine learning. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Currently working on Computer Vision tasks, with some basic architectures: you can see the progress [here](learn_anything/ComputerVision/README.md)

This is still a work in progress, so things will change and links to the various part of the repositories will be provided. Example of what can be seen is [here](learn_anything/Segmentation/README.md) where i explain the differences with the various segmentation tasks. 

The aim of this repo is not only store as a backup all that i have learned and worked on, but also provided simple 1st time code which explains also the step. 

If anyone wants to make a pull request, feel free so that i can also learn how it works on the receving end

As resoruces to learn the HuggingFace library. i am using my own personal fork which can be found: 

* [Hugging Face tutorials](https://github.com/iltranqui/Transformers-Tutorials-raptor) fork of [this repo](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials)
* [Official Notebooks](https://github.com/iltranqui/notebookshf) fork of [This repo](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks)
