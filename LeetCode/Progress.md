## for a complete beginner, what are the step to step process to get better ? 

Here are some steps you can follow to get better at solving problems on LeetCode (or any other platform) as a complete beginner:Start with the basics: 

* Make sure you have a solid foundation in the basics of computer science and programming. This includes concepts such as data types, variables, loops, arrays, strings, and functions.

* Choose a programming language: Choose a programming language that you feel comfortable with and start learning it. There are many programming languages to choose from, so pick one that you are interested in and start learning.

* Practice, practice, practice: As you start learning a programming language, make a habit of practicing as much as possible. There are many resources available online that can help you practice, such as coding challenges on LeetCode or other platforms, coding exercises on websites like HackerRank and CodeSignal, or even building small projects on your own.

* Work through easy problems: Once you have a good foundation in the basics of programming, start working through easy problems on LeetCode or other platforms. This will help you get used to the format and structure of the problems and help you build up your confidence.

* Learn from others: As you work through problems, try to learn from the solutions of others. Look at the different approaches people have taken to solve the problem and try to understand the pros and cons of each approach.

* Don't get discouraged: It's normal to get stuck on a problem or to have to try multiple approaches before finding a solution. Don't get discouraged â€“ just keep practicing and trying different approaches until you find one that works.

Overall, the key to getting better at solving problems is to practice regularly, build a strong foundation in the basics of computer science and programming, and learn from others. With time and practice, you will become more proficient at solving problems.
