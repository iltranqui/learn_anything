## Personal OVerview of Models from Umar

IN these folders there is the code originally from [The Github of Umar](https://github.com/hkproj) which explains many Neural Network architectures in great detail. 

Currently working in 
the following folders:

- `AutoEncoder`
- `GAN`
- `Stabl_Diffusion`
- `Transformers`
- `Vit_multimodal`

The code in these folders was orginally written from Umar, each will be linked as it was modified by me to better understand it.
