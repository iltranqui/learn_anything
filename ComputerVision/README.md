All the following 

ON the Todo list are notebooks for each kinf of image classification.

* Trying to understand how to make a SegNet Model work with an example in both Semantic Segmentation and INstance Segmentation

Check this first tutorial as in how to code from Scratch a [VGG16 and VFF19 architecture](learn_anything/ComputerVision/vgg_tutorial.ipynb) <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/iltranqui/learn_anything/blob/main/ComputerVision/vgg_tutorial.ipynb">

In this notebook you can see how the difference in dpeths of a neural network can affect the speed of training and the final result.

IN the future i will make it modular so that you can try different models. both light weight and heavy weight.
