## Torch Optuna & MLflow 
- [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) is a hyperparameter optimization framework, and [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is a platform to manage the ML lifecycle.

In this example, we will use Optuna to optimize the hyperparameters of a PyTorch model and log the results to MLflow using the Cifar10 dataset. It is a very simple example, but we are here to learn the basics.

To execute the code simply run for an optuna run: 
```python
python hyper.py
``` 
and for 1 training run:
```python
python train.py
```

## Torch Conv3D example
```python
python conv3d_example.py
```
